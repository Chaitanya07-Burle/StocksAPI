First after taking the application we have to execute the code npm install 
after we have to write the code in the terminal npm start
 // Main File is app.js execution starts from app.js file
 //from app.js it will be going to config file and then it wil be going to Connection Folder to connect with database.
 //Then after connected to database execution starts from routes folder
 From Routes ====> service folder ===> model folder 
 after connecting with model folder we will be getting data from database in service folder
 model folder ===>service folder ===> routes folder ===> app.js file ==> Final output in browser
 In this way execution will take place.

 TestCases : command to run test cases is npm run cover it will show the code coverage and how many test cases are passed or failed.

 Note: I have done Frontend in Angular and also integrated with backend but I am not aware of much angular concepts because I am in backend side from past 2 years 10 months so I know basics of angular with that basic concept I have done the angular side.
